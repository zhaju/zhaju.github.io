*the short:*

I'm Julian, a 1A freshman at the University of Waterloo where I'm studying Computing and Financial Management (CFM). My resume is [here](https://zhaju.github.io/resume.pdf). 

*the long:*

I spent roughly 3,000 hours[^1] on public transit commuting to [high school](https://zhaju.github.io/High_School) in downtown Toronto. During that time I [debated](https://zhaju.github.io/Debate) for the national team, did some [ML research](https://github.com/zhaju), wrote [math](https://zhaju.github.io/Math)/CS contests, and met some amazing people. I became particularly interested in the intersection between the sciences and the humanities, namely the applications of math and computers to solve social problems.

More personal: I'm about as type A as it gets. I love to cook, and have been doing it for 5 years. My room is inhabited by many stuffed animals- among them are a dog, moose, and polar bear. I've been boxing inconsistently for about 2 years. My favourite author is Christopher Hitchens; favourite film is *Catch Me If You Can*; favourite show is *Better Call Saul*; favourite artist is NIKI; and favourite reader is you, no quetsion.[^2]
