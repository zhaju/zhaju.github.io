title: About Me
---
*the short:*

I'm Julian, a 1A freshman at the University of Waterloo where I'm studying Computing and Financial Management (CFM). My resume is [here](https://zhaju.github.io/resume.pdf). 

*the long:*

Over 6 years, I spent roughly 3,000 hours[^1] on public transit commuting to [high school](https://zhaju.github.io/High_School) in downtown Toronto. During that time, I [debated](https://zhaju.github.io/Debate) for the national team, did some [ML research](https://github.com/zhaju), wrote [math contests](https://zhaju.github.io/Math), and met some amazing people. I became particularly interested in the intersection between the sciences and the humanities, namely the applications of computers to solve social problems.

[^1]: 3 hours x 200 days x 5 years

More personal: I'm about as type A as it gets. I love food, and have been cooking for family and friends for 5 years. My room is inhabited by many stuffed animals-- among them are a dog, a moose, and a big polar bear. I've been boxing inconsistently for about 2 years. My favourite author is Christopher Hitchens; favourite film is *Catch Me If You Can*; favourite show is *Better Call Saul*; favourite artist is NIKI; and my favourite place to be is here, right on your screen :)[^2]
